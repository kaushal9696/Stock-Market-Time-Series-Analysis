# Stock Market Prediction Machine Learning Model - Can We?
### Time Series Analysis

Predicting the stock market price on the next day with the historical stock data. Data is extracted from yahoo finance website and trend is extracted from google trend. Can we predict the stock market if we have historical data and trend information? Here i am comparing and predicting the stock market price. 

Can only Mean Absolute Error is sufficient to get the model performance?

Can adding more data or adding the trend makes the model run efficient?
